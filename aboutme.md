My name is Sean, I'm practicing to be dad. 

- Can Elsa play with baloons?
  > No, she'll *let it go!*
- Have you ever seen two skeletons fight?
  >Nah, I don't think they'd have the *guts!*
- What did the big flower say to the little flower?
  >Hey there, *bud!*

### My story
Life was going pretty smoothly, you know? I had my routine down: wake up, coffee, pretend to go to the gym, come home, tell everyone I went to the gym, then work. Easy. But then, one day, my wife said, “We’re having a baby!” And just like that, my world shifted into “dad mode.” Suddenly, the simplest tasks became monumental. As an expectant father, I’m basically a walking cliché — the guy who thinks every baby product needs testing... by me.

I now find myself spending an inordinate amount of time learning how to assemble things. Cribs, changing tables, even strollers with more buttons than my TV remote. I’ve also become an expert at practicing dad jokes, because apparently, that’s a skill that comes with the territory.

The funniest moment so far? Trying to swaddle a stuffed animal while telling my future child they’re grounded for life if they dare cry past midnight.

Being an expectant dad is like preparing for the world's most important job interview, except you’ve never done the job, don’t know the boss, and the role lasts forever. But hey, I’m ready to be an expert diaper-changer, world-class stroller-pusher, and undefeated dad-joke champion.

Bring it on, baby!
